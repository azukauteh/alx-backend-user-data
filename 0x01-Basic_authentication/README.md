# 0x01. Basic authentication

HTTP protocol itself contains a very simple authentication mechanism called the Basic Auth. API and web applications are the most common uses of it for user authentication. This README gives the user the necessary information about how to build and deploy Basic Authentication.

What is Basic Authentication?

The Basic Authentication is an approach for HTTP User-agent (e.g., a web browser or API client) to provide username and password when requesting for resource. The username and password are joined into a single string separated by a colon then base64-encoded and then included in the Authorization header of an HTTP request.


# How to Implement Basic Authentication

1. Server-Side Implementation

Receive Authorization Header: When a request is made to your server check if it has an Authorization header.

Decode Credentials: If Authorization header exists, decode the base64 encoded credentials part.

Extract Username and Password: Get the username and password from the decoded credentials string.

Validate Credentials: Verify the username and password against your authentication system (for example, a database of users and hashed passwords).

Grant Access: If the credentials are legitimate, allow access to the requested resource. Otherwise, return a 401 Unauthorized response.

2. Client-Side Implementation

On the client side (for example, on your web browser or API client), you must include the Authorization header in your HTTP requests. undefined

```bash
GET /api/resource HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=
```
In the Authorization header, Basic indicates that Basic Authentication is being used, followed by a base64-encoded string of the username and password separated by a colon (:) .

# Security Considerations

- Base64 Encoding: The credentials are just base64-encoded, not encrypted or hashed, which means that they can be easily decoded if intercepted.

- No Session Management: Basic Authentication lacks session management. The credentials are sent with each request, which makes them vulnerable to interception.

- No Protection against Replay Attacks: Basic authentication does not prevent replay attacks.

# Alternatives
To ensure a more secure authentication, consider using options such as OAuth 2.0, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), or Token-Based Authentication.

# Conclusion

Basic authentication is a simple way of authenticating users in web applications and APIs. Nevertheless, it has certain security limitations and might not work in all cases. Keep your security requirements in mind when implementing Basic Authentication in your project.
